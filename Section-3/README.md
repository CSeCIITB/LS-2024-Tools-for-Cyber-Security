# Module-1 Part-3 (C and Assembly)

Welcome to the final section of LS: Tools for Cyber Security!! <br>
Finally on to something cooler and sounds like hacking, we will study **C programming** and **x86 assembly** in this section. <br>

**C** is a general-purpose programming language like **Python**. **C** is compiled language, unlike Python, which is interpreted.
The difference between compiled and interpreted languages is in their methods of execution. <br>
<br>
First, a bit of background... <br>
Computers can understand and run only machine instructions, but programmers usually code in high–level programming languages, such as C, Python, or Javascript. This is because high–level programming languages are easier to work with and resemble human languages and mathematical notation. However, computers cannot run the code written in a high–level language and hence, there is a need to translate it into simple machine instructions. <br>
As an aside, an **ELF** file essentially only stores these machine instructions!! and runs them on your CPU when you execute it through the command line. Assembly, which is also a part of this week's content, is just these machine instructions written down in a human-readable format.

</p>

Coming back to the point, to do this translation from programming language to machine instructions, we use **compilers** and **interpreters**. 
**Compilers** take a whole program as input and translate it to an executable binary code. The compilation step is required only once. Afterwards, we can run the binary code any number of times. **Interpreters** read and execute the program at hand instruction by instruction. After being read, each instruction is translated into the machine's binary code and run. Unlike compilers, the interpreters do not produce a binary executable file. Each time we run a program, we invoke the interpreter. It then reads and executes the program one instruction at a time. <br>
<br>
C is one of the earliest programming languages but is still in use today. As we have seen in the previous weeks, Linux and Python were both written in C! This makes learning C worthwhile. Also, C provides constructs that map directly to machine instructions, so it is better to learn C alongside Assembly. <br>

NOTE : Do not worry if you don't understand all the details of C and Assembly right away.
       A complete understanding is challenging to achieve in a week and a half.
       This section's content aims to teach you only the very basics.
