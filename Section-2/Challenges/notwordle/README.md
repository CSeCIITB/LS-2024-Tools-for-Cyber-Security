# Notwordle

The description and aim of this challenge is similar to the `bruteforcer` challenge. <br>
Instead of giving the lexicographic order between the input and the actual password, 
the program in this challenge prints the number of characters you got right. 
You must leverage this information to figure out the correct password.

**Flag Format:** flag{...}
