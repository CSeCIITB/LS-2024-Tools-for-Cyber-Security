# The Project

## Part 1: Sudoku Solver

Run the game [sudoku](./sudoku) as:
```bash
chmod +x sudoku # If the file is not marked as executable
./sudoku
```
[ <b>NOTE</b> : The indices, i.e. rows and columns, are zero-indexed (the first element is referred by 0) ] <br>
<br>
You task is to create a program that solves all the presented sudoku puzzles. 
Successfully doing this for the 420 random instances provided by the program will get you the flag.

### Submission Instruction
Create a file `script.py` which solves the challenge. The first line of this file should contain a comment with the flag you obtained.

### Disclaimer:
Note that this project is designed to test your ability to write a Python script that interacts with a binary executable and solves the presented Sudoku puzzles. If you have simply reverse engineered the binary to directly obtain the flag without solving the puzzles, your submission will not be considered.
