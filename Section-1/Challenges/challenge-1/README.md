  # Challenge 1 (Zip Mania) Bash

This challenge is supposed to get you started with bash scripting </br>

* We will use `7zip` and `zip` for this challenge.
* Every time you extract the zip file, you get a new zip file and an ASCII text file containing the password(not encoded) to extract the new zip file.
* To unlock the 7zip/zip files, encode the password to base64, base32, hex, or maybe the text itself. (any one of them would be the correct encoding)
* You have to do this unzipping many times (Ummm... maybe I chose 690 but not sure xD) until you get the flag; hence you need to write a bash script for it

Flag format: flag{...}
