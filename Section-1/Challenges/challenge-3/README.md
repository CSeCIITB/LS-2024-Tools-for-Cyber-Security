  # Challenge 3 (env Pollution) Linux
We have provided you 3 [ELF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) files(compiled C codes)

In each level you need to perform some tasks to get the flag
- level1: get the [environment variables](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/environment-variables-in-linux-unix/) in the spawned shell
- level2: launch the program with no environment variables
- level3: launch the program with an environment variable `CSeC=Awesome`; ensure that the [`argv[0]`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3024202) is equal to `YoS`

PS: You may skip level3, since you will get to know more about it in the upcoming weeks.

Flag format: flag{...}
